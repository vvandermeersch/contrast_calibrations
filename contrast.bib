  abstract   = {Inverse modeling (IM) is a valuable tool in agriculture for estimating model parameters that aid in decision-making. It is particularly useful when parameters cannot be directly measured or easily estimated due to logistical constraints in agricultural settings. Unlike other estimation methods, IM combines a mechanistic model with observations of its outputs to derive the parameters of interest, allowing for the integration of various sources of knowledge. The availability of numerous data sources, such as remote sensing and crowdsourcing, with high spatial and temporal resolution, has expanded the potential of IM in agriculture. Practitioners can now incorporate the spatial and temporal footprint of observational data into parameter estimation. However, common IM techniques currently applied in agriculture often struggle to account for effectively spatial and temporal variability. Relevant IM methods that address these challenges are usually isolated within specific developer and user communities and are not well known within the agricultural community. There is a lack of comprehensive reviews focusing on IM methods suitable for handling spatial and temporal data in agriculture. In parallel, the process of conducting IM in agriculture remains under-formalized. Typically, specific IM methods are chosen for specific combinations of models and types of observational data, but the rationale behind their selection is rarely explained in publications. The relationship between IM methods, models, and observational data is unclear, making it overwhelming for new practitioners to choose an appropriate method. This complex problem, along with the diversity of IM methods, has yet to be adequately addressed while taking into account the specificities of agricultural applications. To address these challenges, this review aims to provide a structured classification of IM methods based on the practical needs of new practitioners in agriculture. It examines a wide range of inversion methods applied in agriculture-related domains and covers four key topics: i) the essential elements and general process of IM, ii) the main families of IM methods in agriculture and their characteristics, iii) the circumstances in which practitioners prefer using IM over other approaches, and their motivations, and iv) practical guidance on choosing a method family based on operational criteria. The review aims to help readers develop a clear understanding of the practice of inverse modeling, gain insights into the diversity of IM methods, and make informed choices when selecting a method family for their agricultural applications.},

  abstract   = {Calibrating process-based models using multiple constraints often improves the identifiability of model parameters, helps to avoid several errors compensating each other and produces model predictions that are more consistent with underlying processes. However, using multiple constraints can lead to predictions for some variables getting worse. This is particularly common when combining data sources with very different sample sizes. Such unbalanced model-data fusion efforts are becoming increasingly common, for example when combining manual and automated measurements. Here we use a series of simulated virtual data experiments that aim to demonstrate and disentangle the underlying cause of issues that can occur when calibrating models with multiple unbalanced constraints in combination with systematic errors in models and data. We propose a diagnostic tool to help identify whether a calibration is failing due to these factors. We also test the utility of adding terms representing uncertainty in systematic model/data systematic error in calibrations. We show that unbalanced data by itself is not the problem—when fitting simulated data to the ‘true’ model, we can correctly recover model parameters and the true dynamics of latent variables. However, when there are systematic errors in the model or the data, we cannot recover the correct parameters. Consequently, the modelled dynamics of the low data volume variables departs significantly from the true values. We demonstrate the utility of the diagnostic tool and show that it can also be used to identify the extent of the imbalance before the calibration starts to ignore the more sparse data. Finally, we show that representing uncertainty in model structural errors and data biases in the calibration can greatly improve the model fit to low-volume data, and improve coverage of uncertainty estimates. We conclude that the underlying issue is not one of sample size or information content per se, despite the popularity of ad hoc approaches that focus on ‘weighting’ datasets to achieve balance. Our results emphasize the importance of considering model structural deficiencies and data systematic biases in the calibration of process-based models.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are important tools to understand and predict the functioning and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems under changing environmental conditions. In these models, uncertainty in the description of demographic processes, in particular tree mortality, is a persistent problem. Current mortality formulations lack realism and are insufficiently constrained by empirical evidence. It has been suggested that empirically estimated mortality submodels would enhance DVM performance, but due to the many processes and interactions within a DVM, the claim has rarely been tested. Here, we compare the performance of three alternative growth-dependent tree mortality submodels in the DVM ForClim: (1) a mortality function with theoretical foundation (ForClim v3.3); (2) a mortality function with parameters directly estimated based on forest inventory data; and (3) the same function, but with parameters estimated using an inverse approach through Bayesian calibration (BC). Time series of inventory data from 30 ecologically distinct Swiss natural forest reserves collected over 35+ yr, including the main tree species of Central Europe, were used for the calibration and subsequent validation of the mortality functions and the DVM. The recalibration resulted in mortality parameters that differed from the direct empirical estimates, particularly for the relationship between tree size and mortality. The calibrated parameters outperformed the direct estimates, and to a lesser extent the original mortality function, for predicting decadal-scale forest dynamics at both calibration and validation sites. The same pattern was observed regarding the plausibility of their long-term projections under contrasting environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate that inverse calibration may be useful even when direct empirical estimates of DVM parameters are available, as structural model deficiencies or data problems can result in discrepancies between direct and inverse estimates. Thus, we interpret the good performance of the inversely calibrated model for long-term projections (which were not a calibration target) as evidence that the calibration did not compensate for model errors. Rather, we surmise that the discrepancy was mainly caused by a lack of representativeness of the mortality data. Our results underline the potential for learning more about elusive processes, such as tree mortality or recruitment, through data integration in DVMs.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic vegetation models provide process-based explanations of the dynamics and the distribution of plant ecosystems. They offer significant advantages over static, correlative modelling approaches, particularly for ecosystems that are outside their equilibrium due to global change or climate change. A persistent problem, however, is their parameterization. Parameters and processes of dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are traditionally determined independently of the model, while model outputs are compared to empirical data for validation and informal model comparison only. But field data for such independent estimates of parameters and processes are often difficult to obtain, and the desire to include better descriptions of processes such as biotic interactions, dispersal, phenotypic plasticity and evolution in future vegetation models aggravates limitations related to the current parameterization paradigm. In this paper, we discuss the use of Bayesian methods to bridge this gap. We explain how Bayesian methods allow direct estimates of parameters and processes, encoded in prior distributions, to be combined with inverse estimates, encoded in likelihood functions. The combination of direct and inverse estimation of parameters and processes allows a much wider range of vegetation data to be used simultaneously, including vegetation inventories, species traits, species distributions, remote sensing, eddy flux measurements and palaeorecords. The possible reduction of uncertainty regarding structure, parameters and predictions of DVMs may not only foster scientific progress, but will also increase the relevance of these models for policy advice.},

One of the most widely used stand-level process-based models is the 3-PG model (Physiological Processes Predicting Growth), which is used for applications including estimating wood production, carbon budgets, water balance and susceptibility to climate change. Few 3-PG parameter sets are available for central European species and even fewer are appropriate for mixed-species forests. Here we estimated 3-PG parameters for twelve major central European tree species using 1418 long-term permanent forest monitoring plots from managed forests, 297 from un-managed forest reserves and 784 Swiss National Forest Inventory plots. A literature review of tree physiological characteristics, as well as regression analyses and Bayesian inference, were used to calculate the 3-PG parameters.},

  abstract  = {The response of forest productivity to climate extremes strongly depends on ambient environmental and site conditions. To better understand these relationships at a regional scale, we used nearly 800 observation years from 271 permanent long-term forest monitoring plots across Switzerland, obtained between 1980 and 2017. We assimilated these data into the 3-PG forest ecosystem model using Bayesian inference, reducing the bias of model predictions from 14\% to 5\% for forest stem carbon stocks and from 45\% to 9\% for stem carbon stock changes. We then estimated the productivity of forests dominated by Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica for the period of 1960–2018, and tested for productivity shifts in response to climate along elevational gradient and in extreme years. Simulated net primary productivity (NPP) decreased with elevation (2.86 ± 0.006 Mg C ha-1 year-1 km-1 for P. abies and 0.93 ± 0.010 Mg C ha-1 year-1 km-1 for F. sylvatica). During warm–dry extremes, simulated NPP for both species increased at higher and decreased at lower elevations, with reductions in NPP of more than 25\% for up to 21\% of the potential species distribution range in Switzerland. Reduced plant water availability had a stronger effect on NPP than temperature during warm-dry extremes. Importantly, cold–dry extremes had negative impacts on regional forest NPP comparable to warm–dry extremes. Overall, our calibrated model suggests that the response of forest productivity to climate extremes is more complex than simple shift toward higher elevation. Such robust estimates of NPP are key for increasing our understanding of forests ecosystems carbon dynamics under climate extremes.},

  abstract  = {Uncertainties in model projections of carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems stem from inaccurate parameterization of incorporated processes (endogenous uncertainties) and processes or drivers that are not accounted for by the model (exogenous uncertainties). Here, we assess endogenous and exogenous uncertainties using a model-data fusion framework benchmarked with an artificial neural network (ANN). We used 18 years of eddy-covariance carbon flux data from the Harvard forest, where ecosystem carbon uptake has doubled over the measurement period, along with 15 ancillary ecological data sets relative to the carbon cycle. We test the ability of combinations of diverse data to constrain projections of a process-based carbon cycle model, both against the measured decadal trend and under future long-term climate change. The use of high-frequency eddy-covariance data alone is shown to be insufficient to constrain model projections at the annual or longer time step. Future projections of carbon cycling under climate change in particular are shown to be highly dependent on the data used to constrain the model. Endogenous uncertainties in long-term model projections of future carbon stocks and fluxes were greatly reduced by the use of aggregated flux budgets in conjunction with ancillary data sets. The data-informed model, however, poorly reproduced interannual variability in net ecosystem carbon exchange and biomass increments and did not reproduce the long-term trend. Furthermore, we use the model-data fusion framework, and the ANN, to show that the long-term doubling of the rate of carbon uptake at Harvard forest cannot be explained by meteorological drivers, and is driven by changes during the growing season. By integrating all available data with the model-data fusion framework, we show that the observed trend can only be reproduced with temporal changes in model parameters. Together, the results show that exogenous uncertainty dominates uncertainty in future projections from a data-informed process-based model.},

We estimate models for these species using data from their native Australia and then assess whether these models can predict the adventive range of these species. We find that the correlative model—MaxEnt—has a superior ability to describe the data in the training data domain (Australia) and that the process-based model—TTR-SDM—has a superior ability to predict the distribution of the study species outside of Australia. The implication of this analysis, that process-based models may be more appropriate than correlative models when making projections outside of the domain of the training data, needs to be tested in other case studies.},

The TTR model considers how carbon and nutrient uptake, and the allocation of these assimilates, influence growth. We use indirect statistical methods to estimate the model parameters from a high resolution data set on tree distribution for 22 European tree species. Results We infer, from distribution data and abiotic forcing data, the physiological niche dimensions of 22 European tree species. We found that the model fits were reasonable (AUC: 0.79–0.964). The projected distributions were characterized by a false positive rate of 0.19 and a false negative rate 0.12. The fitted models are used to generate projections of the environmental factors that limit the range boundaries of the study species. Main conclusions We show that physiological models can be used to derive physiological niche dimensions from species distribution data. Future work should focus on including prior information on physiological rates into the parameter estimation process. Application of the TTR model to species distribution modelling suggests new avenues for establishing explicit links between distribution and physiology, and for generating hypotheses about how ecophysiological processes influence the distribution of plants.},

  abstract  = {Two main types of species distribution models are used to project species range shifts in future climatic conditions: correlative and process-based models. Although there is some continuity between these two types of models, they are fundamentally different in their hypotheses (statistical relationships vs. mechanistic relationships) and their calibration methods (SDMs tend to be occurrence data driven while PBMs tend to be prior driven). One of the limitations to the use of process-based models is the difficulty to parameterize them for a large number of species compared to correlative SDMs. We investigated the feasibility of using an evolutionary algorithm (called covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, CMA-ES) to calibrate process-based models using species distribution data. This method is well established in some fields (robotics, aerodynamics, etc.), but has never been used, to our knowledge, in ecology, despite its ability to deal with very large space dimensions. Using tree species occurrence data across Europe, we adapted the CMA-ES algorithm to find appropriate values of model parameters. We estimated simultaneously 27–77 parameters of two process-based models simulating forest tree's ecophysiology for three species with varying range sizes and geographical distributions. CMA-ES provided parameter estimates leading to better prediction of species distribution than parameter estimates based on expert knowledge. Our results also revealed that some model parameters and processes were strongly dependent, and different parameter combinations could therefore lead to high model accuracy. We conclude that CMA-ES is an efficient state-of-the-art method to calibrate process-based models with a large number of parameters using species occurrence data. Inverse modelling using CMA-ES is a powerful method to calibrate process-based parameters which can hardly be measured. However, the method does not warranty that parameter estimates are correct because of several sources of bias, similarly to correlative models, and expert knowledge is required to validate results.},
